# Calculating-rotation-matrix-of-camera

Figure below illustrates the transformation from coordinate xyz to XYZ: 
1)rotate around z axis with alpha= 45 degree to get x'y'z' axis 
2)rotate around x' axis with beta = 30 degree to get x''y''z'' 
3)rotate around z''
axis with gamma= 60 degree to get XYZ.

Design a program to get the rotation matrix from xyz to XYZ.
